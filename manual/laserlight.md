# Laser / Flashlight

* **Classname:** `UaS_LaserLightModule`
* **Loadout Code:** `llm`

## Mechanics

This item provides a combination laser and flashlight attachment for your weapon to facilitate aiming and visibility, similar to the real-life [AN/PEQ-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AN/PEQ-2). The module can be toggled between flashlight mode, laser mode, or both.

Human-type enemies (undead, jackboots, and marines) can use the flashlight and/or laser sight in darker areas, which may make them easier to spot. Using the NVGs will also make all lasers significantly more visible than with the naked eye.

### Controls

Press the `Use (Inventory)` key (with the item selected) to toggle the currently-selected mode on or off.

Hold the `Use` key and press the `Use (Inventory)` key (with the item selected) to cycle between the following modes:

* 0 = Flashlight only
* 1 = Laser only
* 2 = Both flashlight and laser
