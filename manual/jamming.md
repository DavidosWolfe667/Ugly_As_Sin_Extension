# Weapon Jamming

Provides a rare chance for additional guns (besides the Boss and ZM66) to suffer from failure-to-fire malfunctions.

## Mechanics

Weapons affected by this setting include the semi-auto pistol, the SMG, and the Liberator battle rifle. Much like the Boss rifle, each firing of the weapon adds a very small amount of dirt and grime to the action. Eventually, This can cause the weapon to fail in some way, typically by not ejecting or feeding the next round properly.

That said, most firearms are more reliably constructed than the Boss or ZM66, so such malfunctions are fortunately rare in occurance and minor in severitry. Additionally, in extremely rare instances, a round might simply be a dud. In any case, simply work the action manually (press the `Fire` button) to clear the malfunction and continue shooting.
